Unity 2: Reverb Zones
    1. For the first audio zone, I added it around where the player picks up the mushroom(End of the map, at the opposing side from the player). This was to add an audio que for the player to recognize that something is different about this space in the game. In particular, the reverb of the eerie background noise is ment o spook the player a little bit and help with the weight of the moralchoice they are making when they steal the mushroom.
    2. As for the second audio zone, I have placed it around the well where I intend for the player to make a wish(In the center of the map). With this, the intention, like above, was to make the player recognize that something is different about this space in the game but also allow for an echo of the coin when it drops in the well. This space, after a wish has been made, is intended to help the player recognize a change has been made to the game with their wish.
